Postmortem: Money Transfer Service Outage
Issue Summary
On February 11, 2025, from 13:21 EAT to 19:40 EAT, our money transfer service was non-functional due to a buggy backend file that was pushed to production at 13:20 EAT.

Impact:
Users attempting to send money encountered a blank page instead of the transaction interface.
100% of transactions were affected, causing financial delays and user frustration.
Root Cause:
A recently deployed backend file introduced a logic error that created multiple conflicting operations, overwhelming the server and preventing it from processing transactions correctly.

Timeline of Events
🕐 13:25 EAT – Clients reported blank screens when attempting transactions.
🛠 13:30 EAT – Engineers initially suspected a frontend issue and reviewed the UI components.
🔍 14:15 EAT – After frontend debugging, the issue persisted, indicating a backend problem.
📝 15:00 EAT – Backend logs were analyzed, revealing server overload due to repeated operations from the new file.
🚀 16:30 EAT – Engineers identified and tested a fix in the staging environment.
✅ 19:40 EAT – A patched version was deployed, fully restoring services.
Root Cause & Resolution
🔍 What Went Wrong?
A faulty backend update introduced an unintended loop, causing excessive processing requests.
This overloaded the server, preventing transaction data from rendering properly.
🛠 How It Was Fixed?
Identified and removed the conflicting operations from the backend file.
Deployed a patch that optimized transaction handling logic.
Restarted affected servers and monitored performance to ensure stability.
Corrective & Preventative Measures
To prevent future incidents, we have implemented the following safeguards:

✅ Pre-Deployment Code Reviews – A dedicated team of software engineers will review all code before deployment.
✅ Automated AI Testing – Integrated an AI-based test system to scan for potential issues before deployment.
✅ Stronger Monitoring Alerts – Set up real-time alerts for transaction failures and server overloads.
✅ Rollback System – Developed a fast rollback mechanism for critical service failures.
